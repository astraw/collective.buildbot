The slave recipe
****************

Supported options
=================

The recipe supports the following options:

host
    Host of the buildmaster.
    
port
    Port on which the buildmaster listens.

password
    Sets the password for the buildbot.

Example usage
=============

We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = 
    ...	   buildslave
    ... 
    ... [buildslave]
    ... recipe = collective.buildbot:slave
    ... host = localhost
    ... port = 8888
    ... password = password
    ... """)

Running the buildout gives us::

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Installing buildslave.
    ...
    Generated script /sample-buildout/parts/buildslave/buildbot.tac.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/buildslave'.
