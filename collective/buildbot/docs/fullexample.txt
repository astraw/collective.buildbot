Putting it all together
***********************

Below we will demonstrate how to put all the pieces together to create
a buildbot environment for your own projects. We will use two separate
buildouts: one for the build master and one for a single build
slave. For your own projects you may choose to use multiple build
slaves with each running, for example, on a different architecture or
a different python version.

We'll start with the build master buildout that defines the build
master process and all the projects that we wish to build and test. We
also include a poller configuration that will poll the Subversion
repository for changes the projects and execute the build when changes
have occurred. If we were to use another version control system, such
as Git, we would need to use a commit-hook or a time-based build
scheduler.

We'll also use PyFlakes to perform additional checks on the source
code.

    ... """)

We've allowed forced builds which is quite handy sometimes. Since the
default buildbot web interface is not the most aesthetic we've also
included a directory that contains our custom css.

The ``my.project`` and ``another.package`` packages are simple python
packages so we use the setup.py script to run the test suites. Because
these are simple packages we also clear out the ``build-sequence``
option since there is nothing to do before running the tests. The
``my.buildout`` section is your typical Zope buildout and uses the
Zope controller script, ``zope-instance`` in this particular case, to
run the tests.

Also, because the ``another.package`` project uses a Git repository,
the SVN poller won't apply to it so we've set up a periodic scheduler
that builds the project once in an hour. An alternative would be to
install a post-commit hook to the Git repository that notifies the
buildout of changes and schedules a build.

The ``my.buildout`` project is a buildout based project, so we can use
the default ``build-sequence`` which will bootstrap and run the
buildout for us. For the zope.testing test runner we pass the
``--exit-with-status`` parameter so that buildbot will know whether
the tests failed or not. The trunk may have additional svn:externals
defined that actually pull in the code that is tested which is the
common place. We've also demonstrated using pyflakes on multiple
source packages which may be the case in a full buildout.

Let's run the buildout now.

    >>> mkdir('buildbot_css')
    >>> print system(buildout)
    Installing buildmaster...
    New python executable in /sample-buildout/parts/buildmaster/bin/python
    Installing setuptools............done.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/parts/buildmaster/buildbot.tac'.
    Generated config '/sample-buildout/parts/buildmaster/buildbot.cfg'.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/buildmaster'.
    Installing my.project.
    Generated config '/sample-buildout/parts/projects/my.project.cfg'.
    Installing my.buildout.

    Installing another.package.
    Generated config '/sample-buildout/parts/projects/another.package.cfg'.

As we can see we got the ``bin/buildmaster`` script to run the build
master process and the corresponding configuration files. Our build
master is now ready and you can start it by running::

  $ ./bin/buildmaster start

Next, we create the buildout for the build slave. This buildout may be
located on a different machine although having it on the same machine
will work just as fine.

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = 
    ...    buildslave
    ...    pyflakes
    ... 
    ... [buildslave]
    ... recipe = collective.buildbot:slave
    ... host = buildbot.my.company.com
    ... port = 8080
    ... password = secretpassword
    ... 
    ... [pyflakes]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... eggs = pyflakes
    ... entry-points = pyflakes=pkg_resources:run_script
    ... arguments = 'pyflakes', 'pyflakes'
    ... """)

The slave buildout is very simple since the build master is in charge
of everything and the slave simply needs to contact the master and
receive instructions. We configured the address of the build master
and the password to match the configuration in the build master
buildout above.

We've also included PyFlakes in the slave buildout to assure that it
is available on the slave machine. The pyflakes commands in the master
buildout use a path referring to this version of pyflakes.

Running the buildout will give us the controller script for the slave
and the pyflakes script::

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling...
    Installing buildslave...
    New python executable in /sample-buildout/parts/buildslave/bin/python
    Installing setuptools............done.
    Generated script /sample-buildout/parts/buildslave/buildbot.tac.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/buildslave'.
    Installing pyflakes...
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/pyflakes'.
    <BLANKLINE>

The build slave can be started by running::

  $ ./bin/buildslave start

Once you have both the build master and slave running the poller
should react to commits to the SVN repositories and run the builds
after each change. You can view the buildbot status pages at the
configured address, http://buildbot.my.company.com:8082/ in this
case. You can use the web interface to force a build which can be
useful to verify that the buildbot and projects are configured
correctly.

It is now easy to add new projects or build slaves by modifying the
buildout configurations and rerunning the buildouts.
