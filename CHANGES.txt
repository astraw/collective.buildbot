  - Refactored the repository URL configuration. For Subversion, you
    should use only the ``repository`` option to specify a full URL to

    Git in addition to setting the ``repository`` option you can use
    the ``branch`` option to specify a specific branch to build. By
    default the ``master`` branch will be used for Git
    repositories. [dokai]
