0.3.4 SVN/Unreleased
====================
 
  - Completing work from r67547 (e.g. Fixed occurrences of
    `email-notification-recipients` to the singular form as used in most 
    places.).  When initializing collective.buildbot.project.Project we want 
    to actually look for the singular version.  Additionally, we want our 
    comment regarding notifications in master.cfg_tmpl to suggest the correct
    value to be set.

  - Make timeout configurable, globally and independently for build
    and test steps.
    [sidnei]

  - Strip always_use_latest option to avoid issues with whitespace.
    [sidnei]

  - Make Source Checkout retry up to 3 times, 10 seconds
    apart. Somehow later versions of buildbot seem to fail much more
    often when removing the checkout directory, and hopefully this
    will work around that.
    [sidnei]

  - Make Source Checkout mode configurable through ``vcs-mode``.
    [sidnei]

  - Make ``build`` steps set ``haltOnFailure=True``. No point in doing
    any testing if the build steps failed.
    [sidnei]

  - Fixed compatibility problem with buildbot 0.7.9
    [dokai]

  - Fixed problem with the test suite initialization which resulted in all 
    the doctests not being run. Also fixed test regressions that had surfaced
    undetected because of the problem.
    [dokai]

0.3.3 (2008-09-26)
==================

  - Apply patch from Chris Shenton to override default umask
    [gawel]

  - Improve default template configuration
    [gawel]

  - Add clean css to template
    [gawel]

0.3.2 (2008-09-14)
==================

    [gawel]

  - Fixed occurrences of `email-notification-recipients` to the singular form
    as used in most places.
    [hannosch]

  - Added a mechanism to have username/password for Subversion authentication
    Which consists of a buildbot patch and a link to .httpauth on buildout 
    side
    [tarek]

  - Add dependency between projects. The build of one project can
    trigger the build of one other. [thefunny]

  - Improve the virtual env creation for Windows (mingw) and Cygwin.
    Installation of eggs works with mingw, and we should get a python
    ../../bin/python for Cygwin as well (symlink to the python used to
    run buildout). [thefunny]

0.3.1 (2008-05-31)
==================

  - Fixed poller documentation and examples [mustapha]

  - Fixed failed tests when your executable is called something other
    than python, e.g python2.4 [mustapha]

0.3.0 (2008-05-28)
==================

  - Use a custom scheduler to get poller working again [gawel]

  - Add splitter option to the poller recipe [gawel]

  - Added support for running PyFlakes on projects [dokai] 

  - Refactored project name extraction logic [dokai]
    
    - Added Git support

    - Added support for defining multiple projects that result in
      duplicate project names (e.g. projects referring to different
      branches in a Subversion repository.)

  - Try to retrieve project name from svn urls [gawel]

  - Use a random minute in cron-scheduler when we have more than one
    repository [gawel]

  - Deactive virtualenv under cygwin, this doesn't work [thefunny]

  - 'environment' can be used to specify environment variable on
    slaves [thefunny]

  - 'eggs' can be used to install extra eggs in slaves [thefunny]

  - Refactored the functionality of the 'projects' recipe into the
    'project' recipe and removed the 'projects' entry point. [dokai]

  - Refactored the functionality of the 'pollers' recipe into the
    'poller' recipe and removed the 'pollers' entry point. [dokai]

  - Poller config files are now named after the section name, allowing
    multiple poller sections to be defined. [dokai]

0.2.1 (2008-05-21)
==================

  - Fixed a critical typo in the slave name configuration in
    fullexample.txt [dokai]

0.2.0 (2008-05-21)
==================

  - Added irc options so you can attach an irc bot to the master buildbot
    [mustapha]

  - Allow public_html customization [gawel]

  - Added custom about page to link to collective.buildout [gawel]

  - Added support for Git repositories [dokai]

  - Refactored the repository URL configuration. For Subversion, you
    should use only the ``repository`` option to specify a full URL to
    the desired branch (trunk, tag or branch) that will be built. For
    Git in addition to setting the ``repository`` option you can use
    the ``branch`` option to specify a specific branch to build. By
    default the ``master`` branch will be used for Git
    repositories. [dokai]

  - Cleaned up a lot of redundant imports. [dokai]

  - Updated the documentation and examples. [dokai]

  - Deprecated the collective.buildbot:projects recipe [dokai]

  - Fixed problem with missing twistd.log files on first run [dokai]

  - Fixed bug that prevented the master from starting if there weren't
    any SVN pollers configured. [dokai]

  - Added new options ``periodic-scheduler`` and ``cron-scheduler`` to
    set up passive schedulers for projects. [dokai]


0.1.1 (2008-05-02)

  - bugs fixes [gawel]

0.1.0 (xxxx-xx-xx)
==================
